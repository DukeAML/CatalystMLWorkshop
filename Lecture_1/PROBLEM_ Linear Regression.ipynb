Then, if `smooth` is set to True, it creates a sequence of values to use for X-axis on the plot by taking the minimum and maximum of the original X feature and generating a range with 0.1 intervals. Next, it creates a new feature matrix `model_prediction_features` by applying the polynomial regression object poly_reg (if `model_type` is set to 'Polynomial') to the transformed features or just uses the original `X` features (if model_type is set to 'Linear').\n","\n","Finally, the function plots the fitted model on the scatter plot by passing the `model_prediction_features` matrix to the `model.predict()` method and plotting the line in blue color. It sets the title of the plot to show the regression type, sets the axis labels, and then shows the plot using the `plt.show()` function.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Or2uSTfvJaaY"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"dcTIBAEdEyve"},"source":["def plot_model(X, y, model, model_type = 'Linear', poly_reg = None, smooth = False):\n","  \"\"\"\n","  Function to visualize the fitted model on a scatter plot.\n","\n","  Parameters:\n","  -----------\n","  X : numpy array\n","      The feature array.\n","  y : numpy array\n","      The target array.\n","  model : fitted model object\n","      The trained model object that is used for prediction and plotting.\n","  model_type : str, optional (default='Linear')\n","      A string indicating the type of regression model used.\n","      If set to 'Linear', the function uses the original features in X.\n","      If set to 'Polynomial', the function uses poly_reg to transform X.\n","  poly_reg : polynomial regression object, optional (default=None)\n","      The polynomial regression object that is used to transform the features when model_type is set to 'Polynomial'.\n","  smooth : bool, optional (default=False)\n","      A boolean variable to indicate if the plot should have a smooth line or not.\n","\n","  Returns:\n","  --------\n","  None\n","  \"\"\"\n","\n","  # Plot the scatter plot of X and y with color red\n","  plt.scatter(X, y, color = 'red')\n","\n","  # If smooth is True, create a sequence of values to use for X-axis on the plot\n","  if smooth:\n","    X_grid = np.arange(min(X), max(X), 0.1)\n","    X = X_grid.reshape((len(X_grid), 1))\n","  \n","  # Create new feature matrix based on the model type\n","  model_prediction_features = X if model_type == 'Linear' else poly_reg.fit_transform(X)\n","\n","  # Plot the fitted model on the scatter plot with blue line\n","  plt.plot(X, model.predict(model_prediction_features), color = 'blue')\n","\n","  # Set title, axis labels and show the plot\n","  plt.title(f'Truth or Bluff ({model_type} Regression)')\n","  plt.xlabel('Position Level')\n","  plt.ylabel('Salary')\n","  plt.show()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Plot the model using the above method"],"metadata":{"id":"NrM0g9rzISgs"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"diyJFZHhFFeK"},"source":["## Predicting a new result with Linear Regression"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Blmp6Hn7FJW6"},"source":["# Use the trained linear regression to make a prediction on a new data point\n","# Here, the position level is 6.5\n","# The output prediction is a continuous value indicating the predicted salary"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Rb5nWuSHEfBV"},"source":["## Training the Polynomial Regression model on the whole dataset"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures"],"metadata":{"id":"gdwTufAfHEMD"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"HYplp4pTEm0O"},"source":["# Create a polynomial features object with a degree of 4\n","# Will overfit\n","\n","# Transform the original feature matrix X to include polynomial features up to degree 4\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Create a pandas DataFrame from the transformed polynomial features\n","# The DataFrame will have columns named using the names of the polynomial features\n"],"metadata":{"id":"klKfQ9maKjOM"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Create another Linear Regression object\n","\n","# Train (fit) the model using the polynomial input features (X_poly) and output labels (y)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"EKmnak6eKSeX"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"stOnSo74E52m"},"source":["## Visualising the Polynomial Regression results"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Plot the results of the polynomial regression\n"],"metadata":{"id":"80Qg3q5GIaLh"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"U_qsAMKnE-PJ"},"source":["## Visualising the Polynomial Regression results (for higher resolution and smoother curve)"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Make the same plot as above with a smooth curve"],"metadata":{"id":"_xanwrA2Iu5e"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DW7I7ZVDFNkk"},"source":["## Predicting a new result with Polynomial Regression"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"uQmtnyTHFRGG"},"source":["# Use the trained polynomial regression to make a prediction on a new data point\n","# Here, the position level is 6.5\n","# The output prediction is a continuous value indicating the predicted salary"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
